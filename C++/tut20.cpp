// Starting of Object Oriented Programming Style in C++
// Works on the basis of classes and Objects
// class is just a template to create onjects
// treats data as a critical element

/*Basic concepts in OOPS
Classes - Basic template for creating objects
Objects - Basic run time entities
Data Abstraction & Encapsulation - 
Wrapping the data and functions into a single unit. And separation of concerns.
Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inheritaed to others.
Polymorphism - Ability to take more than one forms.
Dynamic Binding - Code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
Message passing - Object.message(Information) call format.*/

/*Benefits of OOPS
1. Better code reusability using objects and inheritance. 
2. Principal of data hiding helps build secure systems.
3. Multiple objects can co-exist w/o any interferance.
4. Software complexity can be easily managed.*/
