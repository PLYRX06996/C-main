Environmental Science: Unit I - Environment and Ecosystem
Introduction to Environmental Science
Environmental science is the study of:

How the Nature works
How the environment affects the humans and vice versa

"(Environmental science is) an interdisciplinary field that integrates areas of life, physical and earth science to study and address problems facing the environment and to implement science-based solutions."
The science of Environment studies is multi-disciplinary. It comprises various branches of studies like chemistry, physics, medical science, life science, agriculture, public health, sanitary engineering and many more.
Mathematics is indeed necessary for Environmental science. In some classes, basic statistics or algebra is required, while some coursework may require advanced algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.

Definitions of Environment Science
The word 'Environment' is derived from the French word 'Environner' which means to encircle, around or surround. The biologist Jacob Van Uerkal (1864-1944) introduced the term 'environment' in Ecology.
Ecology is the study of the interactions between an organism and its environment. Environmental Science is an interdisciplinary field requiring the study of interactions among physical, chemical and biological components of the Environment with a focus on pollution and degradation.
Environmental Science deals with the study of processes in soil, water, air and organisms which lead to pollution or environmental damages and the scientific basis for establishing standards considered acceptably clean, safe, and healthy for humans and ecosystems.
What is Environment?
Environment refers to the surrounding external conditions influencing development or growth of people, animals, or plants. This involves three questions:

What is surrounded? (Living objects, particularly humans)
By what surrounded? (Human life cannot exist in isolation from animal and plant life)
Where surrounded? (In nature - land, air, water)

Environment belongs to all living beings and is thus important for all. It refers to the sum total of conditions surrounding us in space and time. In modern times, it includes social, economic, and political conditions beyond just physical aspects.
Environment is the sum total of land, water, air, interrelationships among themselves and also with the human beings and other living organisms.

Segments of Environment
The environment consists of four segments:

Atmosphere (Air)
Hydrosphere (Water)
Lithosphere (Land)
Biosphere (Living organisms)

Earth's Formation and Evolution
Earth formed approximately 4.57 billion years ago through processes explained by the Big Bang Theory:

Earth formed from a nebula of gas and dust
The nebula collapsed, spinning into a disk shape
This material condensed into planets, moons, and asteroids

Earth's atmosphere evolved from:

Secondary atmosphere rich in water vapor, CO2, and nitrogen
Water vapor condensed into liquid water, forming oceans and rivers

Earth's crust evolved as the planet cooled, forming a stable surface with different interior zones containing various materials.
Life on Earth evolved beginning in the Archean eon (4.0-2.5 billion years ago), with dinosaurs evolving during the Mesozoic era (252-65.5 million years ago).
Early Earth Development
During its first half billion years, Earth's surface was repeatedly bombarded by asteroids and comets. One of these collisions formed the Moon approximately 50 million years after Earth's creation (Giant Impact Hypothesis).
The early Earth heated up due to:

Collisions (transfer of kinetic energy into heat)
Compression
Radioactivity of elements (uranium, potassium, thorium)

About 100 million years after initial accretion, iron began melting and sinking to form Earth's core. This global chemical differentiation was completed around 4.3 billion years ago, resulting in Earth's layered structure.
Chemical Composition of Earth
The whole Earth consists of: Fe+O+Si+Mg = 93%
The crust consists of: Si+O+Al = 82%
Earth's layers include:

Lithosphere: strong, rocky outer shell including crust and upper mantle (~100 km)
Asthenosphere: weak, ductile layer beneath lithosphere
Deep Mantle: below asthenosphere (400-2900 km depth)
Outer core: liquid shell of mostly iron
Inner core: solid innermost sphere primarily of iron

Continents formed from solidified magma that floated up from the mantle. Oceans and atmosphere were created through out-gassing from volcanic eruptions.
The Evolving Atmosphere
Earth's initial atmosphere was thin and composed mainly of helium and hydrogen, which escaped into space. Volcanic out-gassing created a thicker atmosphere with various gases:

Water vapor (H2O)
Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Ammonia (NH3)
Methane (CH4)

Oxygen was not created by volcanic eruptions. Water on Earth came from volcanic eruptions and possibly comet impacts, with the earliest evidence of surface water dating back about 3.8 billion years.
By 3.5 billion years ago (when Earth was a billion years old):

Earth had a thick atmosphere of CO2, methane, and water vapor
Extensive oceans and seas existed
Life had begun to emerge
The atmosphere contained almost no oxygen (compared to today's 21%)

By 2.5 billion years ago, continents had formed with a lighter density (2.8 g/cm³) than ocean floor crust (3.2 g/cm³).
Planet Earth Structure

Geosphere (Lithosphere): Crust (<1% of Earth), Mantle, Cores
Hydrosphere (oceans): Includes Mariana Trench (~0.2% of Earth's radius)
Atmosphere: Extends to 120 km (99% of air within 30 km)
Biosphere: Zone where life exists
Magnetosphere: Shields Earth from harmful radiation

Detailed Examination of Earth's Segments
Atmosphere

Forms a protective layer about 100 km thick
Protects Earth from the Sun's harmful UV rays
Regulates temperature
Composed of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and trace gases
Absorbs cosmic rays and electromagnetic radiation

Issues to address in the atmosphere include:

Pollution and acid rain
Ozone depletion
Composition (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen)
Aerosols, air quality, atmospheric chemistry, pressure, radiation, temperature, water vapor, winds, clouds, precipitation, and weather events

Hydrosphere

Comprises all water resources (oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, etc.)
Oceans represent 97% of Earth's water
Polar ice caps and glaciers hold about 2%
Only 1% is available as fresh water

Issues to address in the hydrosphere include:

Petroleum discharge
Improper sewage disposal
Thermal pollution
Eutrophication
Acid rain
Greenhouse gas buildup

Lithosphere

The solid component of Earth (soil, rocks, mountains)
Contains three layers:

Core (inner and outer): Central fluid/vaporized sphere ~2500 km from center
Mantle: 2900-3000 km thick layer above core (molten state)
Crust: Outermost solid zone 8-40 km thick



Biosphere

The realm of living organisms and their interactions with the environment
Encompasses the atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere supporting life systems

Biogeochemical Cycles
Natural processes where elements cycle in various forms between different environmental compartments:

Water Cycle
Carbon Cycle
Nitrogen Cycle
Oxygen Cycle
Phosphorus Cycle
Sulfur Cycle

The Water Cycle
Life on Earth depends on water. The water cycle involves:

Evaporation: Change of liquid to water vapor
Condensation: Change of water vapor to liquid
Precipitation: Atmospheric water falling to Earth (rain, snow, sleet, hail)
Transpiration: Evaporation of water from plants

Carbon Cycle
Carbon enters the living world as CO2 through photosynthesis, creating carbohydrates. These organic compounds pass from producers to consumers and return to the atmosphere through:

Respiration
Decomposition
Burning of fossil fuels

The carbon cycle involves:

Atmosphere (CO2)
Photosynthesis by autotrophs
Energy usage by organisms releasing CO2
Living organisms containing carbon
Soil receiving carbon from dead organisms
Fossil fuels storing carbon over millions of years
Pollution from combustion releasing carbon

Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen (N2) makes up about 78% of our atmosphere but needs conversion to be usable. The cycle includes:

Nitrogen Fixation: Conversion of N2 → NH3 through:

Natural processes (lightning, volcanic action)
Industrial processes (fertilizer production)
Bacteria (Azotobactor, Clostridium, Nostoc)


Nitrification: Conversion of NH3 → NO3 by soil bacteria
Assimilation: Roots absorb nitrogen compounds for nucleic acids and proteins
Ammonification: Breakdown of organic compounds into NH3 or NH4
Denitrification: Reduction of NO3 to N2 by bacteria

Oxygen Cycle

Moves through atmosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere
Oxygen makes up 21% of atmosphere
Released by plants during photosynthesis
Inhaled by animals who exhale CO2
Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis, continuing the cycle

Phosphorus Cycle

Moves through hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere
Phosphorus is extracted by rock weathering
Erosion carries phosphorus to soil and water bodies
Plants and animals obtain phosphorus for growth
Decomposition returns phosphorus to soil and water

Sulfur Cycle

Moves through rocks, water bodies, and living systems
Released by rock weathering and converted to sulfates
Microorganisms and plants convert sulfates to organic forms
Animals consume organic sulfur through food
Decomposition returns sulfur to soil
