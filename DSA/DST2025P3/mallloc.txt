Dynamic Memory Allocation in C.
Dynamic memory allocation using malloc(), calloc(), free(), and realloc() is essential for efficient memory management in C.
Dynamic Memory Allocation can be defined as a procedure in which the size of a data structure (like Array) is changed during the runtime.
C provides some functions to achieve these tasks. There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming
C malloc() method
The “malloc” or “memory allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size.
It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form. It doesn’t Initialize memory at execution time so that it has initialized each block with the default garbage value initially. 

Syntax of malloc() in C

ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size)
ptr = (int*) malloc(100 * sizeof(int));

Since the size of int is 4 bytes, this statement will allocate 400 bytes of memory. And, the pointer ptr holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.
